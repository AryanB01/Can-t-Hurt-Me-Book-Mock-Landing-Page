                    <strong>In Can't Hurt Me</strong>, former Navy SEAL David Goggins describes his
                    transformation from someone who let his circumstances control him to
                    someone who proactively seeks greatness by tackling new challenges.
                    He thinks everyone can work to cultivate a drive for
                    self-improvement in order to overcome obstacles and reach their
                    goals.

                    Most of us only give 40 percent of our effort, leaving 60 percent on
                    the table and falling short of our potential. Goggins offers 10
                    actionables to help people push themselves to address obstacles and
                    work efficiently toward their goals.
